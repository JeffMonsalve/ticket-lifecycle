Karen is creating a ticket using the help topic "Business Critical Outage" because customers are reporting that they’re unable to access mobile banking. This categorization helps prioritize the issue and ensures it’s routed to the appropriate team quickly.

In this example, we're setting the ticket's priority to Emergency because the issue could impact a large part of the business. We've also updated the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top-level technician. In some ticketing systems, customers may be able to choose their own SLA plans when submitting a ticket.

The assigned agent begins working on the issue, keeping the user informed with regular updates. In this case, the agent identified the problem as an update issue. Once the issue was resolved, the ticket was successfully closed.
